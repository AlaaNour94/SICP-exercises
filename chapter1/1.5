If the interpreter is using applicative-order evaluation then it will try to evalute every arguments before appliying the function.
and becuase (p) is a recuresive function with no base case it will continue to evalute forever (infint loop).

but if the interpreter is using normal-order evaluation then it will try to evalute the function before the arguments so it will be expanded to

"""
(if (= 0 0)
    0
    (p))
"""

then it will not evalute (p) and it will return 0.
